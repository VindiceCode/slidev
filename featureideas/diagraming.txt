 for AI diagramming:

Prep

I have a bunch of diagrams in my Claude projects as references. I have 1-2 or more references for each diagram type (logical block diagram, process flow diagram, architecture diagrams, swimlane etc.). Goes without saying, but I label them consistently as well.

For each diagram type, I have a prompt that accompanies the diagram that helps me organize the description of the diagram, without getting into so much detail that i might as well do it manually.

In my experience, the quality and consistency of reference diagrams play a huge role in getting this right.

Process

I kick off the prompt. It contains the role, context, ultimate objective, diagram type, colour scheme preferences, font preferences, diagram structure and success criteria. Most of it is prefilled. I fill in the blanks. It's typically bullet points with additional notes.

The prompt requires Claude to create an SVG diagram. At this point, Claude usually gets it right in the first try.

I then give this SVG code to Claude with another simple prompt to convert this into a draw.io compatible XML.

8/10 times the draw.io diagram can be used without any issues. Just select everything, copy as image, paste into your presentation and you're done. With extremely complex diagrams, arrows get a little hairy. Still, 80% of the time aligning and editing is done.
